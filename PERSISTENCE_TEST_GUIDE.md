# LocalStorage Persistence Test Guide

## üß™ Testing localStorage Data Persistence

This guide will help you verify that the Material Calculation Job System correctly saves and loads data from localStorage.

### Prerequisites
- Development server is running on http://localhost:3001
- Browser with localStorage support (all modern browsers)

### Test Scenarios

#### ‚úÖ Test 1: Initial Sample Data Loading
1. **Fresh Start**: Open the application in a fresh browser session (or clear localStorage)
2. **Expected Behavior**: 
   - Application should load with sample jobs already displayed
   - Jobs should be automatically assigned sequential job numbers
   - Sample jobs should be saved to localStorage automatically

#### ‚úÖ Test 2: New Job Submission Persistence
1. **Submit a New Job**:
   - Go to "Submit New Job" tab
   - Select a category (e.g., "Density Calculations")
   - Fill in job details:
     - Title: "Test Job Persistence"
     - Objectives: "Testing data persistence functionality"
     - Requirements: "Verify localStorage integration"
     - Your Name: "Test User"
   - Click "Submit Job Assignment"

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Job should be assigned a new sequential number (e.g., DE2025004)
   - Automatically switch to Job List tab
   - New job should appear in the list

#### ‚úÖ Test 3: Data Persistence After Page Refresh
1. **After submitting the test job**, refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - All jobs (sample + new) should still be visible
   - Job numbers should remain the same
   - All job details should be preserved
   - No data loss should occur

#### ‚úÖ Test 4: Sequential Job Numbering
1. **Submit multiple jobs** in the same category
2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Job numbers should increment sequentially
   - Each category should maintain its own numbering sequence
   - Example: DE2025001, DE2025002, DE2025003, etc.

#### ‚úÖ Test 5: Cross-Session Persistence
1. **Close the browser completely**
2. **Reopen browser** and navigate to http://localhost:3001
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - All previously submitted jobs should still be present
   - Data should persist across browser sessions

### üîç How to Inspect localStorage (Developer Tools)

#### Chrome/Safari:
1. Press F12 (or right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
2. Go to "Application" tab
3. Navigate to "Local Storage" ‚Üí "http://localhost:3001"
4. Look for key: `material-calculation-jobs`

#### Firefox:
1. Press F12 (or right-click ‚Üí Inspect Element)
2. Go to "Storage" tab
3. Navigate to "Local Storage" ‚Üí "http://localhost:3001"
4. Look for key: `material-calculation-jobs`

### üìã What to Look For in localStorage

The stored data should be a JSON array containing job objects with:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid-string",
    "jobNumber": "DE2025001",
    "title": "Job Title",
    "category": "density-calculations",
    "objectives": "Job objectives...",
    "requirements": "Job requirements...",
    "submittedBy": "User Name",
    "status": "submitted",
    "submittedAt": "2025-05-26T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

### üêõ Troubleshooting

#### If data is not persisting:
1. **Check browser localStorage support**: Most modern browsers support it
2. **Check for JavaScript errors**: Open browser console (F12) and look for errors
3. **Verify localStorage is not disabled**: Some privacy modes disable localStorage
4. **Check storage quota**: localStorage has size limits (usually 5-10MB)

#### If job numbers are not sequential:
1. **Clear localStorage** and refresh to test with clean state
2. **Check category prefix mapping** in the code
3. **Verify date handling** for year-based numbering

### ‚ú® Expected Features Working:

- ‚úÖ **Automatic job numbering**: Category prefix + year + sequence
- ‚úÖ **Data persistence**: Jobs survive page refreshes and browser restarts
- ‚úÖ **Sample data loading**: Initial demonstration data on first visit
- ‚úÖ **Form reset**: Form clears after successful submission
- ‚úÖ **Report generation**: PDF and Markdown exports work with persisted data
- ‚úÖ **Filtering**: Category and status filters work with persisted jobs

### üéØ Success Criteria

The localStorage persistence is working correctly if:
1. ‚úÖ Sample jobs load automatically on first visit
2. ‚úÖ New jobs persist after page refresh
3. ‚úÖ Job numbers increment sequentially
4. ‚úÖ All job data (title, objectives, requirements, etc.) is preserved
5. ‚úÖ Data persists across browser sessions
6. ‚úÖ No JavaScript errors in browser console
7. ‚úÖ localStorage contains valid JSON data

**Note**: This system uses localStorage for persistence, which is suitable for demo and development purposes. For production use, consider implementing a proper database backend.
